In today's rapidly evolving transportation industry, understanding and predicting passenger satisfaction has become crucial for improving service quality and customer experience. This project leverages machine learning techniques to analyze various factors influencing passenger satisfaction. By using this dataset, we aim to develop a predictive model that can accurately forecast passenger satisfaction levels. This model will assist transportation companies in identifying key areas for improvement, ultimately leading to enhanced service delivery and increased customer satisfaction.
To achieve this, we collected a comprehensive dataset of airline passenger feedback, including various factors such as service quality, seat comfort, in-flight entertainment, and overall satisfaction ratings. We processed the data to handle any missing values and standardized the features to ensure consistency. Using this cleaned dataset, we trained several machine learning models including logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, XGBoost and others. to predict passenger satisfaction. After evaluating the performance of these models, we selected the one with the highest accuracy and fine-tuned it parameters to optimize its predictive capabilities. The final model was then validated using a separate test set to ensure its reliability in predicting passenger satisfaction.
Our exploration included analyzing the importance of various features to understand which factors most significantly impact passenger satisfaction. We also performed cross-validation to ensure the model's performance was consistent across different subsets of the data. Additionally, we visualized the results using graphs and charts to provide a clear insight into the model's predictions and the underlying trends in passenger feedback. This comprehensive approach allowed us to build a robust model capable of accurately predicting airline passenger satisfaction.
Parallel to this, we load the dataset into Tableau to gain a deeper understanding of passenger satisfaction. By visualizing the results, we can effectively identify areas that are performing well and those that require improvement. through interactive dashboards, Our goal is to leverage these insights to implement targeted strategies that address any shortcomings and elevate service quality.
This project will be delivered through a web application deployed on PythonAnywhere, where end users can interact with the model to predict passenger satisfaction and analyze survey results. The user-friendly interface will allow users to input various parameters related to their travel experience, such as flight duration, amenities, and service quality, to generate real-time predictions of satisfaction levels.
Additionally, the application will feature visualizations that summarize key insights from the dataset, enabling users to explore trends and correlations. By incorporating interactive elements, users can filter data and view results based on different criteria, facilitating a comprehensive understanding of passenger sentiments.
